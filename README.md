## About the game
### How it works
The purpose of the game is to form as many words of length greater than or equal to 3, given a set of 16 scrambled letters in either 1, 2, or 3 minutes based on the game's difficulty.    
There are 3 difficulty levels
> Easy - 1 minute  
> Medium - 2 minutes    
> Hard - 3 minutes  
  
The 16 letters organised in a 4 x 4 grid are chosen at random. Try your best to make as many different words as possible and score as many points as you can!
#### Good luck!
